## 1. Definition of Risk
### 1.1 What is Risk?
**ISO 31000 (2018):** _“Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives.”_  
👉 Simpler: Risk is the chance that something uncertain happens that prevents the bank from meeting its goals.
- In banking, risk = potential uncontrolled loss due to events impacting assets/liabilities.
- Example: **Credit Risk** – borrower fails to repay loan because of unemployment, inflation, currency depreciation, or political turmoil.
- Other examples: operational risk, fraud, liquidity, market, and reputational risk.

**Core concept of banking risk management:**
- Ensure profitability.
- Ensure capital is used efficiently.
- Provide adequate buffers to keep bank solvent.

### 1.2 Risk Management Standards
#### (A) ISO 31000:2018
- Purpose: Creation & protection of value.
- Components: **Principles**, **Framework**, **Process**.
- 8 Principles of Effective Risk Management:  
     1. Integrated – part of all organisational activities.  
     2. Structured & comprehensive – consistent results.  
     3. Customised – fit to context of bank.  
     4. Inclusive – involve stakeholders.  
     5. Dynamic – adapt to change.  
     6. Best available information – based on data & forecasts.  
     7. Human & cultural factors – behaviour affects outcomes.  
     8. Continual improvement – improve with experience.

#### (B) COSO Framework (2017)
- Definition: _“The culture, capabilities, and practices, integrated with strategy-setting and performance, that organisations rely on to manage risk in creating, preserving, and realising value.”_
- **5 Components:**  
     1. Governance & Culture  
     2. Strategy & Objective-setting  
     3. Performance  
     4. Review & Revision  
     5. Information, Communication & Reporting
- **Internal Control (COSO 2013):** Achieving objectives in operations, reporting, compliance via control environment, risk assessment, control activities, info/communication, and monitoring.

### 1.3 Comparing ISO 31000 vs COSO
**Similarities:**
- Both expand risk management beyond “avoiding losses” → support value creation.
- Both are guidelines (not certification standards).
- Both embed risk into decision-making.

**Differences:**

|Aspect|ISO 31000|COSO|
|---|---|---|
|Length|16 pages|100+ pages|
|Focus|Strategic planning, risk oversight|Corporate governance|
|Geography|Global standard, adopted by >57 countries|US-focused, PwC-linked|
|Audience|General risk practitioners|Audit, accounting, compliance|
|Risk Appetite|Light touch|Extensive, with visuals/examples|

👉 Exam Tip: ISO = concise, global, risk-focused; COSO = detailed, governance-heavy, accounting/audit origins.

## 2. Classification of Risk
### 2.1 Financial Risk
- Possibility a firm cannot meet obligations.
- Includes **Credit Risk, Market Risk, Liquidity Risk**.
- Example: Subprime Crisis 2008 – banks faced massive loan defaults → liquidity crisis → government bailouts.
    
### 2.2 Non-Financial Risk
- Related to non-financial transactions.
- Includes **legal & compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk**.
- Harder to measure → banks invest in governance, compliance staff, fraud detection, IT risk controls.
    
### 2.3 Enterprise Risk
- Risks threatening organisation’s operations & objectives (business risk).
- Includes tech failures, supply chain, M&A, innovation risk.
- Many risks **uninsurable** (e.g., reputational damage from data breach).
    
**ERM Framework:**
- Risks assessed across enterprise.
- Risk responses: Avoid, Accept, Transfer (insurance), Mitigate (controls).
- Includes **risk culture, appetite, documentation, training, monitoring**.
- Do’s: Gain board support, embed in strategy, holistic view.
- Don’ts: Treat ERM as a one-off project, siloed approach, complacency.

## 3. Types of Risk
### 3.1 Operational Risk
**BIS definition:** _“Risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events.”_
- Includes legal risk; excludes strategic/reputation.

**Sources of Operational Risk:**
1. **People** – error, fraud (e.g., Barings Bank 1995 collapse by rogue trader Nick Leeson).
2. **Process** – weak controls, faulty models, failed transactions.
3. **Systems** – IT breakdowns, outdated infrastructure, cyberattacks.
4. **External Events** – natural disasters, terrorism, pandemics.
5. **Fraud Risk** – internal fraud (rogue trading, embezzlement), external fraud (cybercrime, scams).

---
### 3.2 Market Risk
**BIS definition:** _“Risk of losses in on/off balance sheet positions from movements in market prices.”_  
Types:
- **Interest Rate Risk** – mismatch of deposits vs loans (negative gap exposure).
- **Equity Price Risk** – systematic (market beta) vs non-systematic (company-specific).
- **FX Risk** – fluctuations in exchange rates → losses (example: Bank ABC lost MYR1m on USD trade).
- **Commodity Price Risk** – e.g., gold trading banks exposed to price swings.

---
### 3.3 Liquidity Risk
- _Risk of bank’s inability to meet obligations when due._
- Bank run example: **MBF Finance 1997** – panic withdrawals → RM12b withdrawn → BNM takeover.

---
### 3.4 Credit Risk
**Definition (Basel):** _“Potential that a bank borrower or counterparty fails to meet obligations.”_
- **Exposure** (individual loans, portfolio concentration).
- **Failure to pay** (admin errors, covenant default, restructuring, insolvency, bankruptcy).
- **Potential losses** (probability of default, loss given default).
- Managed by credit scoring, monitoring, audits, and systems like **CCRIS** (BNM’s Central Credit Reference Info System).

---
### 3.5 Legal & Compliance Risk
- Risk of fines, penalties, faulty contracts, lawsuits, non-compliance with laws.
- Example: 2019 fines – Standard Chartered ($1.1b AML breach), Citi (£43.9m reporting failure).

### 3.6 Strategic Risk
- Loss from poor strategic choices, failure to adapt to tech/economic changes.

### 3.7 Reputational Risk
- Negative publicity → loss of customers, revenue.
- Example: **Enron scandal (2001)** – collapse due to fraudulent accounting → destroyed reputation & Arthur Andersen.

### 3.8 Business Risk
- External/internal factors lowering profit or leading to failure.
- Influenced by demand, costs, competition, economy, regulations.

---
## 4. Roles, Methodologies & Governance
### 4.1 Importance of Risk Management
- Protect against shocks (2008 crisis, COVID-19 pandemic).
- Supports stability, customer confidence, and compliance.

### 4.2 Risk Governance Framework
- Board sets risk appetite.
- Senior management executes.
- Independent risk function.
- Strong internal controls + IT systems.

### 4.3 Risk Management Methodologies
- Risk identification & measurement.
- Risk limits & guidelines.
- MIS for monitoring & reporting.
- Internal controls + audits.

---
## 5. Risk Management Control Functions
### 5.1 Three Lines of Defence
1. **Business Lines** – originators, manage risks in products & processes.
2. **Risk Mgmt / Compliance** – oversight, framework, challenge assumptions.
3. **Internal Audit** – independent review, assurance, corrective actions.
### 5.2 Portfolio Management
- Objectives: **Liquidity, Risk, Income** (trade-offs).
- Principles: asset allocation, diversification, balancing debt/equity, growth vs safety.

## 6. Risk Management Process

Steps (ISO 31000 / BNM):
1. Identify risks.
2. Assess & measure (likelihood × impact).
3. Evaluate vs risk appetite/tolerance.
4. Treat (avoid, reduce, transfer, accept).
	- **Avoid** = eliminate.
	- **Reduce** = control/mitigate.
	- **Transfer** = insure/share.
	- **Accept** = tolerate within appetite.
5. Monitor & review.
6. Communicate & consult with stakeholders.

---
## 7. Emerging Risks
- **Cybersecurity** – phishing, ransomware, data breaches.
- **Climate Risk** – floods, drought, stranded assets → credit & operational risks.
- **Fintech Risks** – digital banks, crypto, new fraud patterns.
- **Pandemics & Shocks** – COVID-19 disruptions, supply chain, systemic failures.
