# 1. Customers to Banks
### 1.1 Banker-Customer Relationship
**Definition:**  
_A customer to banks is someone who has an account with a bank where a relationship exists between the bank and the customer. In general, any individual or entity, which conducts banking transactions with a bank, is the bank's customer._
👉 _Simpler_: A customer is anyone who has a banking relationship — either by opening an account or conducting banking transactions.
**Nature of Relationship**:
- Bank = debtor (borrows money from customer).
- Customer = creditor (lends money to bank).
- Relationship based on **contractual agreement** (account opening forms, loan agreements, etc).

**Case Law: Foley v Hill (1848)**
- Landmark ruling that clarified the bank–customer relationship is **debtor–creditor**, not trustee–beneficiary.
- Bank owns the money deposited; must repay equivalent sum + interest as agreed.
- _Importance_: Gives banks the right to use deposited funds for lending and investments.

**Key Duties of Banks** :
1. Honour cheques and payment instructions.
2. Maintain secrecy of accounts (_FSA 2013 Section 133_).
3. Provide statements and accurate records.
4. Provide services with reasonable care and skill.

**Key Duties of Customers**:
1. Provide correct information.
