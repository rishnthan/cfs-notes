## 1. Lending in Banking
### 1.1 Philosophy of Lending
- **Definition:** Lending is when a bank (lender) provides funds, property, or other assets to a borrower with expectation of repayment (principal + interest/profit).
- **Core to banks:** Lending generates income (interest/profit, fees) but carries the **highest risk exposure**.
- **Philosophy:**  
     • Loans should be made **safely**, with high probability of repayment.  
     • **Profitability matters** – loans must earn more than the bank’s cost of funds.  
     • Loans should support **productive economic activities**.  
     • Banks must maintain **public trust** – reckless lending → systemic collapse.

👉 _Simpler_: Lending = biggest money-maker for banks, but also the riskiest. It must be prudent, productive, and profitable.

---
### 1.2 What is Credit?
- **Definition:** _Credit is the ability of an individual or business to obtain the present value of money or a guarantee from the bank, while deferring the repayment of principal and interest/profit to a future date._

- **Characteristics:**  
     • Always involves **risk of default**.  
     • Governed by **BNM rules, internal credit policy, and contracts law**.  
     • Repayment terms: depend on loan type, size, tenure, borrower’s income/cashflow.  
     • Security/collateral is often required.  
     • Loan pricing reflects borrower risk.

👉 _Simpler_: Credit = “borrow now, repay later,” but the bank carefully prices and conditions it because of default risk.

---
### 1.3 Principles of Lending
#### The 7 Lending Principles (Figure 3.3)
1. **Compliance with Parameters**  
     - Loans must follow **internal credit policies** + **external laws/regulations**.  
     - Example: Bank can’t lend for gambling business (illegal under Malaysian law).
2. **Purpose & Repayment Source**  
     - Purpose must be declared & productive.  
     - Repayment source = _first way out_: income/cash flow.  
     - _Second way out_: collateral.
3. **Two Ways Out**  
     - Every loan must have at least **two repayment routes**:  
      • Primary: cashflow/income.  
      • Secondary: liquidation of collateral.
4. **Profitability**  
     - Loan pricing (interest/profit rate) must exceed cost of funds + cover operational/risk costs.
5. **Quality > Quantity**  
     - Focus on reliable, existing borrowers with strong track record.  
     - Avoid chasing volumes that increase risk.
6. **Character & Integrity**  
     - Borrower must be trustworthy, ethical, financially responsible.  
     - Avoid fraud risks or borrowers with bad history (check CCRIS/CRAs).
7. **Understand the Business**  
     - Banker must know how the customer’s business generates cash flow.  
     - Example: seasonal businesses (oil palm, tourism) → repayment must match cycles.

👉 _Exam trap_: “Two ways out” = first cashflow, second collateral.

---
#### Internal & External Credit Parameters (Figure 3.4)
**Internal Parameters**
- Bank’s **Credit Policy** (Board approved):  
     • Define industries avoided (e.g., gambling, illegal).  
     • Loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) and margins.  
     • Exposure limits by sector/borrower.  
     • Security requirements.  
     • Loan pricing rules.  
     • Minimum financial statements required.  
     • Credit grading system.

**External Parameters**
- **BNM laws/regulations:**  
     • Financial Services Act (FSA) 2013.  
     • Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA) 2013.  
     • AMLA 2001 (Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing).  
     • Companies Act 2016.  
     • National Land Code 1965 (land charges).  
     • Hire Purchase Act.  
     • Contracts Act 1950.  
     • Stamp Duty Act 1949.
    
- **BNM Guidelines:**  
     • Single Counterparty Exposure Limit (SCEL).  
     • Connected Party Transactions.  
     • Foreign Exchange Administration (FEA).

👉 _Simpler_: Banks must follow **their own policies** + **BNM & law requirements**.

---
#### Credit Risk Management Principles (7) (Figure 3.5)
1. **Proportional Stake**  
     - Borrower must show own commitment (“skin in the game”).  
     - Examples: margin requirement, capital injection, equity financing.
2. **Pari Passu**  
     - Bank must rank equally with other lenders in case of liquidation.  
     - Avoid subordinated positions unless priced properly.
3. **Protection**  
     - Collateral must fully cover exposure, including interest & costs.  
     - Ensure proper valuation and registration.
4. **Control**  
     - Loan must be structured so bank remains in control (covenants, monitoring rights).  
     - Example: restrictions on dividend payouts, debt covenants.
5. **Appropriate Tenor**  
     - Loan tenure must match economic life of asset financed.  
     - Example: Car loan max ~9 yrs, housing ~35 yrs.
6. **Well-Spread Portfolio**  
     - Diversify across sectors, geographies, borrowers.  
     - Prevent concentration risk.
7. **Good First Way Out**  
     - Loan must be repaid primarily from borrower’s income/cashflow.  
     - Collateral is only a backup.

👉 _Simpler_: Credit risk management = ensure borrower is invested, loan is structured safely, collateral is solid, and repayment relies on cashflow.

#### Responsible Lending Guidelines (BNM, 2019 update)
**Objective:** Prevent excessive household & SME debt → promote financial stability.
- **Loan Tenure Caps:**  
     • Housing loans: max 35 yrs.  
     • Personal financing: max 10 yrs.  
     • Motor loans: max 9 yrs.
    
- **Margin of Finance:**  
     • 1st & 2nd housing loan: up to 90%.  
     • 3rd housing loan: capped at 70%.
    
- **4 Key Areas:**
	1. **Suitability & Affordability Assessment** – DSR checks, income verification.
	2. **Disclosure** – Key Fact Sheets, transparency on terms.
	3. **Recovery** – Fair treatment in hardship, moratoriums, rescheduling options.
	4. **Consumer Protection** – No mis-selling, fair allocation of repayments, early settlement allowed, complaints channels (e.g., OFS).

## 2. Credit Process Cycle
### 2.1 The 5 Stages (Figure 3.9)
1. **Origination**  
     - Loan application & initial screening.  
     - Collect KYC documents.  
     - Preliminary checks: credit bureau, industry exposure, purpose.
    
2. **Analysis & Approval**  
     - **Quantitative:** DSR, gearing, liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, projections.  
     - **Qualitative:** Management quality, market conditions, competition, borrower reputation.  
     - Use **5Cs** & **CAMPARI** frameworks.  
     - Credit Committee approval required for large exposures.
    
3. **Credit Administration**  
     - Prepare Letter of Offer (LO).  
     - Loan & security agreements drafted.  
     - Stamping & registration (NLC for charges, CCM for debentures, High Court for PoA).  
     - Facility system setup.  
     - Disbursement only after conditions precedent met.
    
4. **Monitoring & Supervision**  
     - Track loan utilisation (ensure used for stated purpose).  
     - Monitor repayments, arrears, covenant compliance.  
     - Exception reports & early warning signals.  
     - Regular reviews of borrower’s financial statements.
    
5. **Recovery**  
     - Triggered by arrears/default/breach.  
     - Steps: demand notices, restructuring, legal action, foreclosure, auction of collateral.

### 2.2 The 5 Cs of Credit
1. **Character** – honesty, integrity, past repayment behaviour.
2. **Capacity** – borrower’s income/cash flow, repayment ability.
3. **Capital** – owner’s equity; “skin in the game.”
4. **Collateral** – assets pledged.
5. **Conditions** – external factors: industry, economic, regulatory risks.

---
### 2.3 CAMPARI Framework
- **Character** – trustworthiness.
- **Ability to Repay** – income stability, cashflow adequacy.
- **Margin of Advance** – borrower contribution → lowers bank’s risk.
- **Purpose** – must be legal & productive.
- **Amount** – proportionate to capacity.
- **Repayment** – tenure, repayment structure (monthly, bullet, instalments).
- **Insurance** – collateral protection (fire, theft, MRTA).

👉 _Exam trap_: Insurance is part of CAMPARI.

---
## 3. Legal Status of Borrowers
- **Individuals:**  
     • Must be ≥18 years (Contracts Act 1950).  
     • Mentally incapacitated cannot contract.  
     • Bankrupts – disqualified (Bankruptcy Act 1967).
     
- **Business Entities:**  
     • Sole Proprietorship – unlimited liability, ROBA 1956.  
     • Partnership – 2–20 owners, unlimited liability, Partnership Act 1961.  
     • LLP – LLP Act 2012, separate legal entity, limited liability.  
     • Companies – Companies Act 2016, need board resolution, director authority.
     
- **Others:**  
     • Societies – Societies Act 1966.  
     • Trustees – Trustee Act 1949, holds property on behalf of beneficiaries.

---
## 4. Secured & Unsecured Lending
- **Secured:** Supported by collateral (mortgage, hire purchase, plant & machinery, FD pledges).
    
- **Unsecured (clean loan):** No collateral, higher risk.  
     • Typically for strong corporates or salaried customers (credit cards, personal loans).

---
## 5. Credit Mediation Bureau (OFS)
- Formerly IMB (1992) → FMB (1997) → now Ombudsman for Financial Services (OFS).
- Independent, free service for resolving disputes between FIs & customers.
- Customer must first complain to bank; can escalate to OFS if unresolved after **60 days**.

---

## 6. Credit Documentation, Information & Verification
- **Documents required:** IC, payslips, EPF, bank statements, tax returns, property titles, audited accounts.
- **BNM CCRIS:** Centralised borrower record – facilities, arrears, repayment conduct (0–9 codes).
- **Credit Reporting Agencies (CTOS, Experian):** Provide litigation, directorships, trade references.
- **Why important:** Ensures enforceability of loan & collateral, protects bank in court.

---
## 7. Securities
- **Purpose:** Secondary repayment option if borrower defaults.
- **Types:**  
     • Land & property.  
     • FD & deposits.  
     • Shares & marketable securities.  
     • Receivables.  
     • Insurance policies.
- **NLC 1965 rules:** Charges must be registered (Form 16A); priority by order of registration; “indefeasible title” once registered.
    
---
## 8. Guarantees & Indemnities
- **Guarantee:** Third party promises to repay if borrower defaults. Liability = **secondary**.
- **Indemnity:** Broader; obligor agrees to make good any losses. Liability = **primary** (can be called even without default).
- Common in corporate/SME lending (directors guarantee loans).

---
## 9. Digital Innovations in Lending
- **E-KYC:** Online ID verification.
- **AI credit scoring:** Uses big data, alternative credit sources.
- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts, tamper-proof loan records.
- **Fintech P2P lending:** Expanding access to credit (regulated under Securities Commission).
- **BNM stance:** Encourages digitalisation, but ensures compliance with FSA/IFSA.
